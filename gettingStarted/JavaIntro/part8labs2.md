## Part 8 Lab 2 - Printing Numbers from 1 to 20

### Overview
In this lab, you will create a Java program that uses a while loop to print numbers from 1 to 20. This lab will help you practice working with while loops to iterate through a range of values and perform actions for each iteration.

### Instructions

1. Create a file called `Part8Lab2.java` in the `PreLeap/Labs` directory.

2. Implement the program using a while loop to print numbers from 1 to 20.

### Starter Code
```java
//class declaration
    //main method
        /*
         Your solution goes here
        */

```

3. Write the code inside the `main` method to print numbers from 1 to 20 using a while loop.

4. Compile and run your program to verify that it correctly prints the numbers.

### Testing Your Code

To test your code, open Git Bash and navigate to the directory containing your Java file (`Part8Lab2.java`). Then, compile and run the program using the following commands:

```bash
javac Part8Lab2.java
java Part8Lab2
```

### Expected Output

After running the program, it should print the numbers from 1 to 20 in the terminal:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19
20
```

Ensure that your code correctly prints the numbers in the specified range.
