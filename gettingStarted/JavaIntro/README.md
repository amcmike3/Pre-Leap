### Part 3: Java Intro

### Overview

Welcome to the second section of pre launch where you will get your first taste of Java programming.

To maximize your learning, we recommend that you only use a bare bones a text editor (such as notepad or vs code without any extensions) and GitBash. Typing out each line of code manually, although it may seem laborious it gets easier later. For now we need to get the reps in and reinforces increases the speed which you will learn.

This means that at least for the pre launch material copy and paste should be off limits.

Once you complete each exercise, use what we learned about `git` to push your solutions to your GitHub repository. These pre-launch exercises are a graded component of the program. You'll gain valuable experience with `git` as you progress through your work, and your code will be publicly accessible, making it easy to reference during the program.

After completing the tasks in this section, you'll find some optional tasks that you can tinker with. [Extras](../extras/README.md).

### Structure

Each part below follows a similar structure:

1. Read the learning material on the topic.

2. Use what you just learned by completing a lab exercise.

3. Use `git` to push your completed work to GitHub for review before you begin the program.

   - Step 1 creating a repository. [Step 1 - Setup](part1.md) provides detailed setup instructions.
