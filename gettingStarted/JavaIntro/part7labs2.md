## Part 7 Lab 2 - Menu Selection with Switch Cases

### Overview
In this lab, you will create a Java program that allows users to select items from a menu using a switch statement. This lab will help you practice implementing a menu-driven program and using switch cases for different menu options.

### Instructions

1. Create a file called `Part7Lab2.java` in the `PreLeap/Labs` directory.

2. Implement the program based on the following pseudocode. Replace the pseudocode comments with actual Java code.

```java
//import scanner

//class declaration
    // main method
        //declare scanner

        // Display a menu with options
        

        // Prompt the user to enter a choice
        

        // Use a switch statement to handle menu selection
        

        // close scanner
```

3. Complete the program according to the pseudocode provided. Implement the menu display, user input, and switch cases to handle menu options.

### Testing Your Code

To test your code, open Git Bash and navigate to the directory containing your Java file (`Part7Lab2.java`). Then, compile and run the program using the following commands:

```bash
javac Part7Lab2.java
java Part7Lab2
```

### Expected Output

After running the program, it should display the menu, allow the user to select an option, and provide the corresponding message based on the user's choice. Ensure that your code correctly handles menu selections and provides the appropriate messages for each option.

* When you're done don't forget to push your new code to github. 
    (`git add .`, `git commit -m "some message",`, `git push origin master`)
