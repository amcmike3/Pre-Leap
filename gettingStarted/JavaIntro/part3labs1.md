## Objective 2 Lab 1 - Printing a Variable

### Overview
In this lab, you will create a Java program to print the value `"Hello World"` stored in a variable named `helloWorldVariable`. This will help you practice using variables and printing their values in Java.

### Instructions

1. Create a file called `Part3Lab1.java` in the `PreLeap/Labs` directory.

2. Use the provided starter code and add your solution in the commented area.

### Starter Code
```java
public class Part3Lab1 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String helloWorldVariable = "Hello World";

    //  TODO: Print the value stored in the 'helloWorldVariable' variable
    
  }
}
```

### Testing Your Code

To test your code, open gitBash and navigate to the `PreLeap/Labs` directory containing your Java file (`Part3Lab1.java`). Then, compile and run the program using the following commands:

```bash
javac Part3Lab1.java
java Part3Lab1
```

### Expected Output

After running the program, you should see the following output:

```bash
Hello World
```

Your program should successfully print the text `"Hello World"` to the console.
