## Touch Typing

### Overview
As a programmer it is imperative that you are a proficient typist. Not only must you be comfortable with the standard character set you also need to be comfortable with `special characters`

Your success in your career as well as in this program will rely heavily on your ability to type both quickly and accurately. The most effective typing strategy that will assist you in this pursuit is 'Touch Typing'.

**Do not underestimate the necesity of being a proficient typist**

### Touch Typing

*Touch Typing* is the practice of typing without using your sense of sight to find keys. A proficient typist knows the location of keys on the keyboard via muscle memory. A touch typist can focus their attention on what is being typed on the screen while still typing accurately.



Typically *Touch Typing* involves placing your fingers on the _home row_ to orient your initial position on the keyboard with the left index finger on `F` and the right index finger on `J`.

* Most keyboards have a physical mark on these two keys that you can feel with your index fingers.

### Assignment

**If you are already a _Touch Typist_**, take a typing test to determine your current speed and accuracy typing code. You should be able to type faster than 20 words per minute with over 90% accuracy as you begin the program.

* Test your typing ability at [Typing.io](https://typing.io)
 and selecting one of the 'Java/Guava' lessons. The benefit of Typing.io is that they will have you practice typing with actual code. 

* To be fair, most touch typists will struggle with that test. It turns out we don't use special characters that much in the normal course of life. So if you're not all the way there here are some starting resources:

**If you are NOT a _Touch Typist_**, it is important to take typing seriously (painters paint, programmers type).

* *[Typing Club](https://www.typingclub.com/sportal/program-3.game)* provides free resources to learn touch typing (https://www.typingclub.com/sportal/program-3.game), you should begin these lessons immediately and continue them until you begin the program. You should also strive to use touch typing in your day to day life as practice.

* Practice typing in code with your touch typing skills at [Typing.io](https://typing.io)
 until it improves your accuracy and speed when typing code.
