## Part 4 Lab 1 - Calculating the Average of 5 Numbers

### Overview
In this lab, you will create a Java program that calculates the average of five numbers provided as input. You'll practice using variables, and mathematical operators to compute and display the average.

### Instructions

1. Create a file called `part4Lab1.java` in the `PreLeap/Labs` directory.

2. Use the provided starter code and add your solution in the commented area.

### Starter Code
```java
public class part4Lab1 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Declare variables to store five numbers and the average
    double num1, num2, num3, num4, num5;
    double average;

    /*
      Your solution goes here
    */

  }
}
```

### Testing Your Code

To test your code, open git bash and navigate to the directory containing your Java file (`part4Lab1.java`). Then, compile and run the program using the following commands:

```bash
javac part4Lab1.java
java part4Lab1
```

### Expected Output

After running the program should calculate and display the average of 5 numbers.

For example:

```bash
The average of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 is: 30.0
```

Ensure that your code correctly calculates and displays the average of the five numbers entered by the user.
