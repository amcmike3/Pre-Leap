## Part 2 : Typing, Git bash, Git

### Overview

In this part of your pre-leap work you will get introduced to some of the tools Software Engineers use on a regular basis. 

Carpenters have hammers, Electricians have screwdrivers, and Software engineers have the **Terminal**. Our terminal is Git Bash it runs a program called a **Unix Shell** which lets you type commands, navigate through and modify files on your computer, and much more than you could simply do with a typical file explorer. Being able to utilize the terminal effectivelly is pertinent to the success of any developer. For this reason, by the end of this program you will be able to circumnavigate the terminal yourself.

But how useful is a hammer without arms or the ability to swing it? This is why you'll also need to master the skill of typing. 
You can only code as quickly as you can type and a single typo can crash an entire application. Your ability to type quickly and accurately is the very first block that must be laid to build the software engineer that you will become. We will test your benchmark speed and if it does not meet our standards it is required that you practice and improve until you meet those standards.

Lastly, to finish this section off we will intrduce you to Git and Github. git is a bersion control software that nearly all developers use to collaborate on projects and control how code bases are updated. Github is a cloud based storage and social media site which allows developers to contribute to open source programs and showcase their work. Your Github profile will eventually become the proof you will show to employers that you know what you are doing and you know it well.

It can be easy to down play the importance of the fundamentals but without these foundational pieces, it doesn't matter how well you know Java or any other programming language for that matter. With typing as the most foundational block it is essential that you pay particular attention to your ability to type quickly and accurately without staring at the keyboard.
