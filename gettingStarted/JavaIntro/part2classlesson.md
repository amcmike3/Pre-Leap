Certainly, here's a reworded version for better clarity:

**Lesson 1: Introduction to Basic Java Applications**

**Understanding Classes**

In Java land, applications unfold by executing code sequentially, moving from one line to the next, from top to bottom, and from left to right. This holds true for most programming languages. All the code in a Java program is encapsulated within a construct called a `Class`. Here's an example:

```java
public class ExampleOfAClass {
    // All our code resides within these curly braces.
} 
```

In Object-Oriented Programming, class files serve as the fundamental building blocks. Initially, we'll craft our applications within a single Class file. As you advance in the course and as applications become more complex, you'll begin working with multiple Class files within a single application.

The term `public` is an access modifier but we'll delve deeper into what access modifiers do later on your program journey. For now just accept it because uhhhh... Java. The term `class` signifies that this is indeed a Java Class.

Following the keword `class`, we have the Class's name, "ExampleOfAClass." As a convention, we name all our Java Classes using CapitalCamelCase. This entails capitalizing the first letter of each word while omitting spaces between words. This helps other Java programmers dileneate classes and methods. More on methods next.

Now that we've defined a Java Class, there's one more concept to grasp before we dive into coding.

**Understanding the Main Method**

As mentioned before, Java code executes sequentially from top to bottom. However, it doesn't commence execution at the very top of the Class. It initiates with the first line of something known as the "Main method."

Methods are self-contained segments of code that exist at the Class level. Initially, we'll be placing all our code within the Main method. Later on, we'll break our code into multiple methods which will introduce a very important programming concept of reuseability.

Main isn't just any method; it's special. When we run our Java application, Java knows to start execution from the Main method, specifically from its first line.

Here's what the Main method looks like:

```java
1 public class ExampleOfAClass {
2
3   public static void main(String[] args) {
4     // This is where the application starts.
5   }
6
7 }
```

In this example, we have added line numbers for reference; they won't affect the actual outcome of our application but help us talk with calrity about the code.

- Line 1: This is the class declaration.
- Line 3: This is the declaration of our Main method.
- Line 4: The double slashes denote a comment line. Comments are notes for programmers and don't have any effect on the outcome of the application.
- Line 5: We have a closing curly brace, indicating the end of the Main method.
- Line 7: Another closing curly brace marks the end of the Class.

Also, take note of the indentation each time we write something inside a set of curly braces. This practice significantly enhances code readability, as it clearly distinguishes what's contained within the Main method from what's within our Class. Indentation is a widely recognized convention in programming, and you'll be expected to use it as a programmer.
