## Part 3 Lab 3 - Using Different Variable Types

### Overview
In this lab, you will create a Java program that uses variables of different types to store and print various types of information. You'll practice working with integer, double, boolean, and string variables.

### Instructions

1. Create a file called `Part3Lab3.java` in the `PreLeap/Labs` directory.

2. Use the provided starter code and add your solution in the commented area.

3. Use the variables `age`, `weight`, `isStudent`, and `firstName` to store information of different types (integer, double, boolean, and string). Modify and extend the code to print these variables to the console. 

### Starter Code
```java
public class Part3Lab3 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Declare and initialize variables `age`, `weight`, `isStudent`, and `firstName` as integer, double, boolean, and string

    /*
      Your solution goes here
    */
  }
}
```

### Testing Your Code

To test your code, open gitbash and navigate to the directory containing your Java file (`Part3Lab3.java`). Then, compile and run the program using the following commands:

```bash
javac Part3Lab3.java
java Part3Lab3
```

### Expected Output

After running the program, you should see the following output:

```bash
Age: 25
Weight: 160.5
Is a Student: true
First Name: Alice
```

Ensure that your code correctly stores and prints information of different variable types. You can modify the values of the variables to reflect your own information or experiment with different values.

* When you're done don't forget to push your new code to github. 
    (`git add .`, `git commit -m "some message",`, `git push origin master`)
