# Introduction to HyperText Markup Language (HTML)

## Overview

HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language, is the foundational language of the World Wide Web. Developed by Tim Berners-Lee in the early 1990s at CERN, HTML emerged from the need for scientists to share research over the newly birthed internet. Berners-Lee envisioned a simple yet dynamic language that would enable easy information exchange, and thus, HTML was born. Remarkably, HTML has not only endured but also evolved over more than two decades.

As you progress through this program, after mastering core Java, you will dive headfirst into the realm of web applications. One vital aspect of any web application is its user interfaceâ€”the pages you interact with, their design, and their usability. On the web, this entire user interface is constructed atop HTML. This guide will familiarize you with the fundamentals of HTML and empower you to grasp its core concepts.
