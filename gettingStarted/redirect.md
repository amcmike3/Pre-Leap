# Quantum Leap Academy

## Getting Started

So, you want to become a software engineer with all the money, prestige, and lifestyle that comes with it. Whether or not that becomes the case for you solely depends on how committed you are, how hard you're willing to work during the duration of the course, and how curious you are. 

Whether you have dabbled with coding previously or are just beginning your journey we must begin at the foundation. The course and your success are both built upon understanding the fundamentals and as things become more nuanced, a firm grasp on the fundamentals is required.

The most successful students are the ones who are willing to push through the uncomfortablilty, unfamiliarity, and ask questions. You are bound to feel inadequate at some point during this journey just know that everyone feels it because this is a difficult task. Just be reminded that the most worthwhile things in life are difficult. The money, the prestige, the notoriety, and the lifestyle all must be earned through 16 short weeks of hard work.

This four part setup is meant to help you get your machine set up and give you some exposure to the materials that will ultimately be the base that the rest of your knowledge will be built upon.
