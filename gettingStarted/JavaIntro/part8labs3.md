## Part 8 Lab 3 - Printing Even Numbers from 1 to 20

### Overview
In this lab, you will create a Java program that uses a loop to print only the even numbers from 1 to 20. This lab will help you practice working with for loops, conditions, and selecting specific values within a range.

### Instructions

1. Create a file called `Part8Lab3.java` in the `PreLeap/Labs` directory.

2. Implement the program using a for loop to print only the even numbers from 1 to 20.

3. Write a for loop of any kind that iterates 20 times.
    
4. Write an if statement that determines if the number is even (hint: use the (`%`) operator). Only print the number if it is even (hint: this means it should be fully divisible by 2).

### Starter Code
```java
//class declaration
    //main method
        /*
         Your solution goes here
        */

```

3. Write the code inside the `main` method to print only the even numbers from 1 to 20 using a for loop and a condition to filter even numbers.

4. Compile and run your program to verify that it correctly prints only the even numbers.

### Testing Your Code

To test your code, open Git Bash and navigate to the directory containing your Java file (`Part8Lab3.java`). Then, compile and run the program using the following commands:

```bash
javac Part8Lab3.java
java Part8Lab3
```

### Expected Output

After running the program, it should print only the even numbers from 1 to 20 in the terminal:

```
2
4
6
8
10
12
14
16
18
20
```

Ensure that your code correctly filters and prints only the even numbers in the specified range.
