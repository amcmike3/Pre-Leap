## Part 6 Lab 4 - String Comparison with User Input

### Overview
In this lab, you will create a Java program that takes user input as strings and uses `if` statements to compare them. You'll practice getting user input, comparing strings, and using `if` statements for branching logic.

### Instructions

1. Create a file called `Part6Lab4.java` in the `PreLeap/Labs` directory.

2. Use the provided starter code and add your solution in the commented area.

3. Prompt the user to enter two words or phrases using the `Scanner` class.

4. Compare the user's input strings using `if` statements.

5. If the first input comes before the second input in lexicographical order, print the message: "The first word/phrase comes before the second word/phrase."

6. If the first input comes after the second input, print the message: "The first word/phrase comes after the second word/phrase."

7. If the two inputs are equal, print the message: "The two words/phrases are equal."

8. We hope you are ready for your first leap because we aren't giving you starter code this time. Look at your other files for hints but DO NOT COPY AND PASTE. The main method is used in every Java application and you need to know it. Typing it out will ensure it is engrained.

### Starter Code
```java
//Hints:
// import statement

//class declaration Part6Lab4
    // main method{
        /*
          Your solution goes here
        */
    //}

```

### Testing Your Code

To test your code, open Git Bash and navigate to the directory containing your Java file (`Part6Lab4.java`). Then, compile and run the program using the following commands:

```bash
javac Part6Lab4.java
java Part6Lab4
```

### Expected Output

After running the program, it should prompt the user to enter two words or phrases, compare them, and display the appropriate message based on the comparison:

```bash
Enter the first word/phrase: apple
Enter the second word/phrase: banana
The first word/phrase comes before the second word/phrase.
```

Ensure that your code correctly handles user input and prints the correct message based on the comparison.

* When you're done don't forget to push your new code to github. 
    (`git add .`, `git commit -m "some message",`, `git push origin master`)
