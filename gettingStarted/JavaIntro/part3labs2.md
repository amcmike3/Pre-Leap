 ## Objective 2 Lab 2 - Printing Personal Information

### Overview
In this lab, you will create a Java program that prints out your name, age, and the state where you were born. You'll modify the provided starter code to reflect your own personal information and practice printing variables in Java.

### Instructions

1. Create a file called `Part3Lab2.java` in the `PreLeap/Labs` directory.

2. Use the provided starter code and add your solution in the commented area.

### Starter Code
```java
public class Part3Lab2 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String name = "John Doe";
    int age = 0;
    String state = "Hawaii";

    /*
      Your solution goes here
    */
  }
}
```

### Your Solution Should:

Modify the provided variables `name`, `age`, and `state` to contain your own personal information. Then, use the `System.out.println()` statements to print this information to the console. 

### Testing Your Code

To test your code, open gitbash and navigate to the directory containing your Java file (`Part3Lab2.java`). Then, compile and run the program using the following commands:

```bash
javac Part3Lab2.java
java Part3Lab2
```

### Expected Output

After running the program, you should see the following output with your own name, age, and state of birth:

```bash
Name: John Doe
Age: 0
State of Birth: Hawaii
```

Make sure to replace the values in the code with your own personal information to see your details printed to the console.
