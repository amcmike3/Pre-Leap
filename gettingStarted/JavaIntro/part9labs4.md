## Part 9 Lab 5 - Calculating an Average

### Overview
In this lab, you will create a Java program to calculate the average of an array of numbers using a custom method. You'll practice defining methods with return types, passing parameters, and performing calculations.

### Instructions

1. Create a file called `Part9Lab5.java` in the `PreLeap/Labs` directory.

2. Implement the program to perform the following steps:
   - Define a static method called `calculateAverage` that takes four integers as parameters and returns the calculated average as a `double` value.
   - In the `main` method, create an array of integers with some sample values.
   - Call the `calculateAverage` method, passing the values as arguments, and store the result in a variable.
   - Print the calculated average to the console.

### Starter Code
```java
public class Part9Lab5 {
    // Define the static calculateAverage method here

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Call calculateAverage and store the result
        
        // Print the calculated average
    }
}
```

3. Write the code inside the `calculateAverage` method to compute the average of the array of integers and return the result.

4. In the `main` method, create an array of integers with sample values and call the `calculateAverage` method, passing the array as an argument. Store the calculated average in a variable.

5. Print the calculated average to the console.

6. Compile and run your program to verify that it correctly calculates and displays the average of the array of numbers.

### Testing Your Code

To test your code, open Git Bash and navigate to the directory containing your Java file (`Part9Lab5.java`). Then, compile and run the program using the following commands:

```bash
javac Part9Lab5.java
java Part9Lab5
```

### Expected Output

After running the program, it should calculate and print the average of the numbers to the terminal.

Ensure that your code correctly defines and calls the static method to calculate the average.
