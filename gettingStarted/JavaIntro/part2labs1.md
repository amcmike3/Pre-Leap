# Part 2 Lab 1 - Blasting off

### Overview
* Create a file called _Part2Lab1.java_ in the _PreLeap/Labs_ directory.
(reminder `cd ~/Preleap` to traverse, `mkdir Labs` to make a folder, `cd Labs` to traverse, and `touch Part1Lab1` to create a file, `code Part1Lab1` to open it in vs code)
* Using the _Starter Code_ below add code to the commented area that would print out the value `"3..2..1.. Blast Off"`.


### Starter Code
```java
public class Part2Lab1 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    /*
      Your solution goes here
    */
  }
}
```

Just a quick note: In Java, the semicolon `;` marks the end of a statement, much like a period at the end of a sentence in English. Forgetting to add a semicolon at the end of a Java statement will result in an error that needs to be corrected. Now, let's take a look at the Expected Input/Output to assist you in getting started.

### Expected Input
```bash
javac Part2Lab1.java
java Part2Lab1
```
### Expected Output
```bash
3..2..1.. Blast Off 
```
